      <title>Forecasting Crop Export Values</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present the development and evaluation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model designed to forecast the export value of crop products for a geographical region three years into the future. The model was trained on a dataset comprising historical crop export values along with various climatic and agricultural factors. Our methodology includes preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, and training the MLP model to generate predictions. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). The results indicate that the model performs moderately well for the third year predictions, with R2 value of 0.7009.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Propaganda Detection and Categorisation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research focuses on the detection of propaganda within text, a crucial task for ensuring information integrity across various media platforms. Our study establishes a baseline using Support Vector Machines (SVM) combined with TF-IDF vectors, followed by more sophisticated models incorporating Word2Vec embeddings and BERT sequence classification. The SVM model with Word2Vec targets contextual word similarities while the BERT sequence classification model aims for comprehensive semantic analysis. We assessed the performance of each model based on precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The findings demonstrate that the BERT sequence classification model surpasses the TF-IDF-SVM and Word2Vec-SVM combinations. Although the latter two models achieved comparable F1-scores of 0.68 and 0.69 respectively on the detection task, they were less effective in classifying propaganda techniques. BERT excelled in both tasks, achieving F1-scores of 0.94 in propaganda detection and 0.78 in propaganda categorization, offering enhanced detection capabilities for complex propaganda techniques. This suggests that BERT-based models are more effective in the nuanced identification of propaganda, promoting more reliable and precise text classification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
